I want an index page.
The header should say "Anna's song vault."
The footer should say "© 2026 Anna Kosieradzka" and stick to the bottom of the screen.
The index page should say "Welcome. Pick an era."
Then there should be a row of big squares, each for an era. 
The eras should be in a JSON file. 
The eras are "A fraction of me is irrational" and "Uneven and odd". They should have slugs.
Clicking on an era should open an era page.
