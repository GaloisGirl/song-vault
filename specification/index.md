I want an index page.
The header should say "Anna's song vault"
The footer should say "© 2026 Anna Kosieradzka" and stick to the bottom of the screen. It should be left-aligned.
The index page should say "Welcome. Pick an era."
The index page content and the header should have a light gray background.
The eras are defined in src/_data/eras.json.
Then there should be a row of big squares, each for an era. 
In each square, there should be the era's corresponding image from src/_data/eras.
Below the image, the description should be displayed.
Clicking on an era should open an era page.
